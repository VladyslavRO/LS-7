    <h5>Porshce GT3</h5>
    <p>Carpe diem, they say – seize the day. But we are Porsche. And so our motto for the new 911 GT3 models is: carpe secundum – get the most out of every second.
        We know that your time is precious. And every minute in the cockpit is valuable. So, we have once again intensified everything that makes a sports car: performance, tuning, aerodynamics.
        Time flies. This is your time. Hop in.</p>

    <h5>Ferrari F40</h5>
    <p>Behold the last Ferrari with which Enzo Ferrari was personally involved. The road-legal race car had 470 horses and a turbocharged V-8 that made it the first Ferrari to exceed 200 mph back when it debuted in 1987. The bodywork came from coachbuilders Pininfarina, and in an effort to save as much weight as possible, so little paint was used that you can see the carbon/Kevlar weave. The impetus of the car was Enzo requesting that his team make the “best car on the face of the earth,” one that’s not built for comfort but for sheer speed and performance. The unflinching F40 accomplished all of Enzo’s objectives.</p>
